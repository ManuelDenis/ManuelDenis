# Hi, I'm Popescu Manuel Denis! 👋

I am a Software Development Engineer specializing in web development with a strong focus on building robust backend systems and interactive frontends. My core expertise includes Python, Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL and React.js, along with React-Bootstrap for creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces. I am experienced in developing full-stack applications that are scalable, maintainable, and aligned with modern web standards. Passionate about delivering efficient solutions, I continuously aim to enhance user experience through well-structured, reliable, and performant code.

## 🚀 About Me

I am currently developing a highly secure authentication system for a banking application, leveraging modern web technologies such as Django, Django REST Framework, Next.js, and PostgreSQL.

The system includes:
JWT-based authentication via HttpOnly and Secure cookies
CSRF protection across both browser and API layers
Custom rate limiting and IP-based throttling to prevent brute-force attacks
Google OAuth2 integration for seamless and secure third-party login
2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) using Google Authenticator (TOTP) for critical actions and login
Login lockout mechanism after multiple failed attempts (with exponential backoff)
Granular access control using role-based permissions and API scopes
Strict cookie policies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
Comprehensive security headers, including Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, etc.
XSS and clickjacking protection via frontend sanitization and backend validation
Device/session management, with refresh token rotation and invalidation
Audit logging and traceability for login attempts and permission changes
The architecture is designed to meet financial-grade security standards, with a focus on resilience, data integrity, and attack surface minimization.
